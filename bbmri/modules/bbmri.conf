### A note on Secrets:
###
### Variable with a value of <VAULT> will be fetched from a central component
### upon each bridgehead startup.
### Using the proven Vaultwarden password manager puts you in full control of
### who can read the passwords. In particular, as long as you don't declare a
### secret as shared ("SITE+DKFZ"), DKFZ cannot read these strings.
### We recommend putting credentials such as local passwords into the password
### store, not the git repo. Please keep your master password safe (vault.conf).


### Common Configuration of all Components
## This is the descriptive humanreadable name of your site (e.g. MÃ¼nchen LMU)
SITE_NAME=ECDC-Bridgehead-<National node>
## This is the id for your site used in machine to machine communication (e.g. muenchen-lmu)
SITE_ID=ecdc-bridgehead-<National node>
## This server's hostname, for access from other computers within your institution
## (e.g. mybridgehead.intern.myinstitution.org)
## Optional. If left empty, this is auto-generated via the `hostname` command.
HOST=

## Proxy Configuration
# leave empty if not applyable
# ex.: http://my-proxy-host:my-proxy-port
HTTP_PROXY_URL=
HTTP_PROXY_USERNAME=
HTTP_PROXY_PASSWORD=
HTTPS_PROXY_URL=$HTTP_PROXY_URL
HTTPS_PROXY_USERNAME=$HTTP_PROXY_USERNAME
HTTPS_PROXY_PASSWORD=$HTTP_PROXY_PASSWORD

## Maintenance Configuration
# By default, the bridgehead regularly performs certain housekeeping tasks such as pruning of old docker images to not run out of disk space.
# Set the following to false to opt-out. (Default: true)
#AUTO_HOUSEKEEPING=

### Connector Configuration
## The operator of the specific site.
OPERATOR_FIRST_NAME=
OPERATOR_LAST_NAME=
OPERATOR_EMAIL=
OPERATOR_PHONE=
## SMTP Server
# ex.: mailhost.intern.klinik.de
MAIL_HOST=
MAIL_PORT=
# ex.: no-reply@bridgehead.intern.klinik.de
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=
MAIL_FROM_NAME=

### Monitoring
# The apikey used for reporting to the central DKFZ monitoring. Leave empty to opt out.
MONITOR_APIKEY=

### Biobanking (BBMRI) specifics
## We consider BBMRI as BBMRI-ERIC (European) and German Biobank Node (Germany).
## Obviously, all German biobanks are by definition also European. Thus,
## any Bridgehead will by default connect to the BBMRI-ERIC services but not
## the national ones. We aim to proceed similarly for other BBMRI-ERIC National Nodes.
##
## The default values are correct for biobanks outside Germany.
## For a biobank inside Germany, set ENABLE_GBN=true.
# Connect to the European services, e.g. BBMRI-ERIC Sample Locator (Default: true)
ENABLE_ERIC=false
# Connect to the German services, e.g. Biobank Node Sample Locator (Default: false)
# Set this to true in German biobanks!
ENABLE_GBN=false
# Connect to the ECDC services, e.g. ECDC Sample Locator (Default: false)
# Set this to true in ECDC national nodes!
ENABLE_EHDS2=true
